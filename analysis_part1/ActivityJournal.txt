Implement these functions in the order below.

Your name: Eric Nilsson

================================================================
create_node
Start
Estimated Time	30M
Plan:
Keep implementing the function until the tests pass. Then move
onto the next function.

Complete
Actual Time	3H
Observations: When adding value to a pointer operator an
easy way to derefernce the operator and get the actual value
by using the -> operator.


================================================================
add_node_at_head
Start
Estimated Time	2H
Plan:Implement the p_next and p_previous values and then makes sure
one that works and that i'm able to make them link together.

Complete
Actual Time	1H
Observations: You have to make sure you link all of the nodes together
before you start worrying about where you're going to play the nodes
in the linkedlist. 


================================================================
clear_linked_list
Start
Estimated Time	2H
Plan:IMplement getting rid of the linked list and destorying the connections
inbetween the nodes.

Complete
Actual Time	3H
Observations:You have to deal witht he current node and then free all the nodes
from the current node instead of doing it from the head. Also freeing all the current nodes
and setting them to NULL doesnt chnage the lists actual head and tail so you need to chnage
that to NULL as well.


================================================================
add_node_after_current
Start
Estimated Time	2H
Plan:IMplement adding a node after the current node correctly and run tests to make
sure it works.

Complete
Actual Time	1H30M
Observations:
You need to make sure you link the new node to every thing before actualy changing
anything around in p_list. Also when it's the only node in the list use the function
they give you as a hint because that actually works.

================================================================
find_word
Start
Estimated Time	2H
Plan:
Traverse throught the linked list struct and find the word that they are looking for

Complete
Actual Time	1H 10M
Observations:
You have to compare hte differnce in the strcmp funtion even if the word is < > 0
so that you can find out the intersection poiunt inthe list. Also when traversing
the list make sure you start at the head and then move to the end becasue current
might no be the start of the list
