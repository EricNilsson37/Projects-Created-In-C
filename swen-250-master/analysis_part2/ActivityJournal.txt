Implement these functions in the order below.

Your name: Eric Nilsson

================================================================
process_word
Start
Estimated Time	1H
Plan:
Implement the methods in the functions and run the tests until the function
passes all test calls

Complete
Actual Time	30M
Observations:You can just call the methods fomr the linked_list_function.c without
having to do anything else. Make sure you have you refernce the one_word
correctly as well know the differnce between -> and . 

================================================================
get_first_word
Start
Estimated Time	1H
Plan:
Implemented grabbing the first word in the p_list

Complete
Actual Time	30M
Observations:
make sure that you set the entry.wordcount to 0 instead
of actually returning 0 you return the entry struct.

================================================================
get_next_word
Start
Estimated Time	30M
Plan:
Implement in the function grabbing the next word after the word given in the p_list

Complete
Actual Time	20M
Observations:
Make sure that you change the p_current the the p_current->p_next
becasue you have to update the p_list still

================================================================
get_last_word
Start
Estimated Time	30M
Plan:
Access the p_list->p_tail and make that the entry and then update everything
that needs to be updated in p_list.

Complete
Actual Time	10M
Observations:
All you need to do is take the code from the get_first_word and just make it
access the p_tail instead of the p_head

================================================================
get_prev_word
Start
Estimated Time	10M
Plan:
Just edit the code from get_next_word to just access the value that
comes before it instead of after it

Complete
Actual Time	5M
Observations: It's very easy to change inbetween the get_next_word
with this function becasue you only have to chnage about 2 lines for it to work
since the 2 function operate very similarly.

================================================================
read_file through test 56
Start
Estimated Time	1H
Plan:
Use all the accumulative Methods and functions to pass all the tests and fine tune
any tests that need it.

Complete
Actual Time	6H
Observations:
Even thought all youre test from linked_list_functions passed doesnt mean that they actually work.
I had to replace that entire file with the solutions given before my code actually worked. My
read_file and all other functions with it worked the issues was the linked_list_functions
even thgough all the tests passed.

================================================================
read_file MLK_dream_excerpt only
Start
Estimated Time	1H
Plan:
Implement all need ffunctions and methods while looping through the file

Complete
Actual Time	10M
Observations:
Once all the files are optimized and running well all the test s pass

================================================================
write_unique_word_list_to_csv_file
Start
Estimated Time	1H
Plan:
Loop through all the words and create a csv line for each word

Complete
Actual Time	30M
Observations:
Make sure you use the code given to you like the fopen stuff so that you can edit the csv file.

================================================================
Add four unit tests to the unit_tests_student.c file
Start
Estimated Time	HH MM
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete
Actual Time	HH MM
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
